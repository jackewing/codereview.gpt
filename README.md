## Usage

- Navigate to a GitHub Pull Request or GitLab Merge Request that you want a review for.
- Fill in your [OpenAI API token](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in the Settings of the Chrome Extension
- Click the extension icon
- You get code review comments from ChatGPT in the popup window

**NB:** Running the review multiple times often produces different feedback, so if you are dealing with a larger PR, it might be a good idea to do that to get the most out of it.

## FAQ

###

**Q:** Are the reviews 100% trustworthy?

**A:** No. This tool can help you spot bugs, but as with anything, use your judgement. Sometimes it hallucinates things that sound plausible but are false — in this case, re-run the review.

###

**Q:** What aspects of the Pull Request or Merge Request are considered during the review?

**A:** The model gets the code changes and the commit messages in a [patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch) format. Additionally it pulls in the description of the MR/PR.

###

**Q:** Does the extension post comments on the Pull Request page?

**A:** No. If you want any of the feedback as PR comments, you can copy paste the output.

###

**Q:** Is this a GPT wrapper?

**A:** Yes, [but](https://twitter.com/creatine_cycle/status/1600331160776998913)

###

**Q:** Why would you want this?

**A:** Plenty of reasons! You can:

    - pretend to work while playing games instead
    - appear smart to your colleagues
    - enable a future skynet
    - actually catch some bugs you missed
    - learn a thing or 2 on best practices
